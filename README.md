## Hello World 👋

- I'm Lorenzo (The Boss for friends)
- I study CS & Econ @ Bocconi University
- I'm an AI researcher @ Hephaestus Applied Artificial Intelligence, @ Bocconi Statistics and Data Science Student Association, @ TheHackLab Bocconi Students
- I'm a Quant researcher @ Starting Finance Bocconi and @ Minerva Investment Management Society
- I’m currently working on pure RL to solve the ARC-AGI benchmark. (trying to beat Grok 4 and o3-pro essentially)
- How to reach me: giambralorenzo@gmail.com


## Some Relevant Projects 📌 

Research-Oriented Projects

🧩 **ARC-AGI with Reinforcement Learning**: RL framework for solving ARC-AGI tasks using sequential actions.
- **ARC (v1)**: Built a custom DSL and Wolpertinger Actor-Critic policy for large discrete spaces.
- **ARC (v2)**: Integrated ViT-based state encoding and learnable action embeddings.
- **ARC (v3)**: Designing a hierarchical world model-based agent for ARC-style reasoning.

🌍 **RL World Models Benchmark**: Compared performance of JEPA-style vs. encoder–decoder world models on reinforcement learning environments.


Association-Related Projects

🔢 **Digit Recognition with CNNs**: Built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network on the MNIST dataset.
