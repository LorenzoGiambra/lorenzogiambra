## Research Focus
- Reinforcement learning agents for ARC-AGI tasks, including DSL design, large-discrete-action actor-critic policies, and hierarchical world models.
- Vision transformers and learnable action embeddings for state/action representation in sequential decision-making.
- Comparative evaluations of JEPA-style vs. encoder–decoder world models in RL environments.
