## Hello World 👋

- I'm Lorenzo (The Boss for friends)
- I study CS & Econ @ Bocconi University
- I'm an AI researcher @ Hephaestus Applied Artificial Intelligence, @ Bocconi Statistics and Data Science Student Association, @ TheHackLab Bocconi Students
- I'm a Quant researcher @ Starting Finance Bocconi and @ Minerva Investment Management Society
- I’m currently working on pure RL to solve the ARC-AGI benchmark. (trying to beat Grok 4 and o3-pro essentially)
- How to reach me: giambralorenzo@gmail.com


## Some Relevant Projects 📌 

Research-Oriented Projects

- 🧩 **ARC-AGI with Reinforcement Learning**: RL framework for solving ARC-AGI tasks using sequential actions.
  - **ARC (v1)**: Built a custom DSL and Wolpertinger Actor-Critic policy for large discrete spaces.
  - **ARC (v2)**: Integrated ViT-based state encoding and learnable action embeddings.
  - **ARC (v3)**: Designing a hierarchical world model-based agent for ARC-style reasoning.

- 🌍 **RL World Models Benchmark**: Compared performance of JEPA-style vs. encoder–decoder world models on reinforcement learning environments.


Association-Related Projects

- 📊 **Bankruptcy Prediction Platform**: Led team to build ML pipeline with XGBoost and Random Forests using financial ratios and macroeconomic indicators.

- 📉 **Momentum-Based Portfolio Optimization**: Developed a dynamic SGD optimizer tuned via Bayesian search to outperform static allocation methods and created a trading dashboard integrated with the optimizer to visualize portfolio trends and momentum patterns.

- 🌡️ **[Weather Derivatives Pricing](https://github.com/GianiRanzetti/Minerva---Weather-Derivatives)**: Scraped historical weather data using SQL and implemented forecasting pipeline in Python. Trained an LSTM model to predict daily temperatures across multiple U.S. metropolitan areas and backtested American call options on temperature indices.

- 🏆 **[Customer Churn Predictor for BCG-X](https://github.com/LorenzoGiambra/TheHackLab)**: Placed 2nd in a hackathon challenge by developing a churn prediction pipeline using reinforcement learning, classical ML models, and GenAI-driven web scraping to enhance feature enrichment and customer behavior insights.


Personal Project

- 🏁 **Long/Short Stock Trading Strategy**: Designed and implemented a long/short equity trading system using technical analysis indicators. Integrated trend-following signals and volatility-based position sizing to optimize entry/exit decisions.


University-Related Projects

- 🧩 **K-SAT Solver with Simulated Annealing**: Developed a customized K-SAT solver leveraging Simulated Annealing to explore heuristic approaches for solving NP-complete satisfiability problems.

- 📈 **Solow Growth Model Analysis**: Performed econometric analysis using Solow-growth regression models to evaluate key drivers of cross-country GDP growth.

- 📊 **Human Lifespan Boundaries**: Authored a statistics research paper estimating the boundaries of human lifespan using multiple regression models and extreme value theory.
