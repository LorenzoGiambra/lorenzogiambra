## Hello World 👋

- I'm Lorenzo (The Boss for friends)
- I study CS & Econ @ Bocconi University
- I'm an AI researcher @ Hephaestus Applied Artificial Intelligence, @ Bocconi Statistics and Data Science Student Association, @ TheHackLab Bocconi Students
- I'm a Quant researcher @ Starting Finance Bocconi and @ Minerva Investment Management Society
- I’m currently working on pure RL to solve the ARC-AGI benchmark. (trying to beat Grok 4 and o3-pro essentially)
- How to reach me: giambralorenzo@gmail.com
